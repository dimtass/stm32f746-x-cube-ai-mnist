Universal C Library
----

This repo contains several MIT libraries that can be used universally
and they aren't BSP dependant. These are quite useful for embedded
projects as they are more lightweight.

## List of libs
* `list.h`: This is the Linux kernel list lib
* `trace.h`: Simple trace lib that needs printf
* `various_defs.h`: Various useful defines
* `states.h`: A state machine library
* `time_sched.h`: A timer/scheduler library
* `mod_led.h`: A generic cross-platform module for LEDS
